      Welcome to Indian Institute of Information Technology Senapati, Manipur at Imphal!

The Indian Institute of Information Technology Senapati, Manipur (IIITSM) is an institute of national importance established by an act of parliament in 2015 under the Ministry of Education, Government of India. The objective of the institute is to develop a technology and manpower for Information Technology (IT) related industries and make Manipur as a preferred destination for providing IT-related services and gateway to South-East Asia.

The IIIT Senapati, Manipur offers B.Tech. programmes in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) & Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) and PhD in CSE, ECE and Humanities and Basic Sciences. The campus is in a prime location at Imphal (12km from Airport), adjacent to New Secretariat of the State and across the Manipur Information Technology Park and Software Technology Park of India (STPI) with ample of opportunities for Entrepreneurship. Another campus of IIIT is coming up in 150 acres of land in a scenic slope of beautiful mountains which is well connected through NH2 -National highway at Mayangkhang . IIIT has a vision of establishing itself as an Institution of excellence in Cyber Security, Cyber Crime and Forensic Analysis so that human resource from IIIT Senapati, Manipur will be prepared to face this growing global threat. It also envisages itself for achieving excellence in application of robotics facilitating human life to overcome congenital as well as acquired disabilities. To achieve some of the above objectives it has already signed an MoU with overseas institutions.

Admission to IIIT Senapati, Manipur will be purely on the basis of the All-India Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main and the seat allocation will be through Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) and Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB). I encourage our aspiring young students in higher-secondary schools in the country to appear for JEE (Main) and get into IIIT-Manipur in Imphal. We all look forward to receive the students from all over the world to raise their career prospects into greater heights.

The institute has excellent infrastructure with State of Art classrooms, Laboratories, conference halls, auditorium, playground, hostels, faculty quarters, guest house, and administrative offices. The personalized attention to each student is given through the mentorship by the faculty due to excellent students to teacher ratio. There will be opportunities for internships and semester exchange with premier institutions in the country and abroad. The institute nurtures its students to acquire adequate knowledge, technical and entrepreneurial skills through conducive learning ecosystem in the campus so as to cater the needs of the society and diverse industries. Many industries visit the institute for campus recruitment/placement. In the past-years, the institute has produced many young energetic Engineers with almost hundred percent placements and now they are working in renowned organizations/companies.

I take this opportunity to congratulate all my students who joined this institute for making a very conscious and informed choice to opt for IIIT-Manipur to build a successful career. I assure that all efforts will be made to establish this IIIT as one of the best leading institutions in its chosen area not only in India but in the Global arena. Best wishes to all the Young ambitious students of this great institution.
